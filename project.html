              As a college student, our client knows all too well the heartbreak
              of discovering a once-promising avocado has transformed into a
              science experiment in the back of the fridge. Meal planning is
              tough—especially for students juggling limited time, budgets, and
              a constantly rotating supply of ingredients. Traditional AI recipe
              generators often spit out bizarre, impractical suggestions
              (looking at you, "banana tuna salad"), while basic web scrapers
              drown users in a sea of unverified, low-quality recipes. What
              students really need is a reliable, easy-to-use meal-planning tool
              that won’t suggest putting peanut butter on pasta just because
              both words exist in a database.
              <br />
              <br />
              That’s why we created Lazy Spoon, a community-driven recipe
              generator that combines the best of AI-powered web scraping with
              human curation. Our system pulls recipes from the web, organizes
              them into a structured database, and then lets real users refine,
              review, and remix them—ensuring students get practical,
              student-approved meal ideas. Users can input ingredients they have
              at home, specify dietary preferences, and receive relevant,
              personalized recipe suggestions. Whether you’re a dorm chef making
              magic with a microwave or a student with an actual kitchen (lucky
              you), our platform makes sure you never have to stare into your
              fridge and wonder, "What on earth can I make with this?" again.

              <br />
              <br />
              The purpose of using PHP is to store and retrieve recipes,
              ingredients, costs and name of the meals from the database. Also,
              it’ll be used for user authentication, registering/logging users
              to save their favorite recipes. And users can submit comments and
              ratings for recipes.
              <br />
              <br />
              The purpose of using JavaScript is to implement features like
              search filters, category sorting, and ingredient checklist.
              Furthermore, it’ll be used to check user inputs before submission
              to ensure valid recipe data, email, password, etc. JavaScript can
              be handy to improve user interface like drop-down menu, smooth
              animations and effects for images and detailed recipes.
              <br />
              <br />
              They work together to fetch recipes from a database by PHP and
              represent it in the browser by JavaScript. We can use PHP to
              update, insert, delete recipes inside the database and send a
              success message and JavaScript displays it without refreshing the
              page. When the user submits a recipe, JavaScript validates the
              input, then sends it to PHP for storage.

              When we presented our idea for the name in the Initial Client
              report it was not set and our client did not really comment on it.
              However when we decided on the name and asked for their feedback,
              they said, “I really like the name Lazy Spoon, I think we can go
              with that.”
              <br />
              <br />
              After brainstorming we have decided that fully depending on web
              scraping will be difficult since we will need to get permissions
              from the websites. Our client said they were okay with utilizing
              AI to put the recipes in the same format. So we can pull the
              recipes from different websites without thinking about the
              formatting and AI will put it into a nice form for us.

              Another point of discussion was how accounts would add recipes.
              Our client stated, “I think something unique about this website is
              how community driven it is”. So we have decided to let the users
              add and edit the recipes as they like. The generator will be
              relying on individual experiences as well which makes it
              community-driven. Since our client was concerned about everyone
              being able to add and edit recipes, we have decided to make a
              couple root accounts that will need to go in and approve the
              changes or new recipes to keep the webpage in order.
