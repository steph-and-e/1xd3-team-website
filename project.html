The target users are mostly students who maybe live in dorms and/or student housing and struggling with their meal preps. Since most students own laptops and are comfortable with using it they are more likely access our web page through desktop.</p>
              <p><span class="purple">Static Information: </span>Nutrition tips and how to have a balanced meal will be added as static information. Most of the time people are not informed about nutrition facts which causes them to get more fat/protein than they might need.</p>
              <p><span class="purple">Design Elements: </span>Our client wants to have big pictures, pale tones, and minimalistic feel overall. She does not want the website to be harsh on the eyes.</p>
              <p><span class="purple">Data: </span>Generating most popular receipes based on user’s ratings. Collecting people’s preferences for nutritional facts and allergies.</p>
              <p><span class="purple">Simple Interactive Elements: </span>Our client wants to match people based on their food preferences and favourite foods. This system will be almost like having a penpal who you can talk to about food and your nutrition goals.</p>
