              The first time the user enters the website, there are a couple of
              problems with consistency. Firstly, image sizes are different
              across the page and do not sit on a proper template. Instead, it
              is scattered all around the page. Secondly, every advertisement
              has a different colour, font style, and size, making it eye-soring
              to see what you are looking for. On a different note, some
              paddings of the pictures are blue while others are orange,
              disrupting the consistency. Furthermore, there are three search
              bars on the website in very different areas; you cannot find them
              without a magnifying glass. The company's contact information is
              twice in various font sizes and colours. Overall, this website is
              not consistent. There are also some problems with the ease of
              navigation for the users. Pictures with different sizes,
              unorganized orders and layouts make it hard for viewers to locate
              what they want. Some links to specific items are too small to
              click, and some are located between two frames of the items, so it
              confuses the viewers of which item the link belongs to. The most
              inconvenient part is the horizontal scrolling. It is hard to
              navigate on the web page.

              <span class="purple">Good Website: </span

            <p>
              Hack the North's website maintains a consistent paper/hand-drawn
              theme, creating a cohesive and visually engaging experience. Key
              design elements include a fixed navbar, 2D animations, and uniform
              typography, with common h1, h2, and p styles ensuring readability.
              Each section follows a structured margin system, and h1 tags are
              centered with a distinct “paper” component. The layout is built
              with Flexbox, ensuring responsive and adaptive design. Navigation
              is straightforward, with the navbar linking directly to key
              sections. However, one usability critique was the UI for the “Last
              Year's Winners” section, which could be more intuitive. Another
              minor issue is clickability of sponsor images, which may benefit
              from clearer interaction cues. The site promotes universal
              usability with a well-structured header and footer, ensuring
              accessibility and ease of use across devices.
